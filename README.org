* Abstract

=xunitgen= is a python module for the simple production of =xunit= or =junit=
XML files for use in continuous integration. Such as with =Jenkins=.

It converts a stream of timed (start/finish/error) events and convert
them into a report.

It brings / need no dependencies besides an installation of =Python 2=.

Also look at =nose='s xunit (more mature at this time) plugin if you're
interested in producing such xml files:

  http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/xunit.html

* Using

Simply add the directory surrounding =xunitgen= into your =PYTHONPATH=, then:

#+begin_src python
import xunitgen

receiver = xunitgen.TestEventReceiver()
receiver.begin_case('a-test', 0, 'foo')
receiver.failure('because', 'ExceptionFoo')
receiver.end_case('a-test', 9)

print xunitgen.tostring(receiver.results())
#+end_src

See also the source code for the event_trace module, it can serve as
an example for the API:

file:xunitgen/event_trace.py

* Contributing

If you want to make code contributions to =xunitgen= here are 
the steps to follow to get a working development environment:

Create a virtual environment and activate it

#+begin_example
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
#+end_example

Install development dependencies

#+begin_example
$ pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
#+end_example

With the virtual environment active, test your changes before submitting:

#+begin_example
$ nosetests -s tests
#+end_example
